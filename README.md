ecs-rs
======
An Entity Component System (ECS) library written in Rust.

**For info about why an ECS may be beneficial, see some of these articles:**

There is a large variety of ways an ECS may work. This particular one is similar to
[Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/).
Although this isn't a port to Rust, most functionality should be similar, and the
tutorials/manual there should be able to make up for the current lack of documentation here.

**A little more information is available in the rustdocs.**

Run:
```
$ cargo doc
```

With ecs-rs as one of the dependencies, and open the `ecs` docs up in your browser of choice.
